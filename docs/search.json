In the given visualization the salary amount is a round off figure and we made three proper visualization from the above data set we took .We will be doing Bar graph, Scatter Plot , Line graph as proper visualization.\n\nsalary&lt;-read.csv('C:/Users/HP/Downloads/US companies.csv')\nstr(salary)\n\n'data.frame':   26 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ rank               : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ employer           : chr  \"Palo Alto Networks\" \"NVIDIA\" \"Twitter\" \"Gilead Sciences\" ...\n $ median_total_salary: chr  \"1,70,929\" \"1,70,068\" \"1,62,852\" \"1,62,210\" ...\n $ X                  : logi  NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n\nhead(salary)\n\n  rank           employer median_total_salary  X\n1    1 Palo Alto Networks            1,70,929 NA\n2    2             NVIDIA            1,70,068 NA\n3    3            Twitter            1,62,852 NA\n4    4    Gilead Sciences            1,62,210 NA\n5    5             Google            1,61,254 NA\n6    6             VMware            1,58,063 NA\n\n\n\n#bar graph\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(salary, aes(x = employer, y = median_total_salary,group = 1)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",fill = 'blue') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nThe result is that the resulting graph is a bar chart where each bar represents a different employer, and the height of each bar corresponds to the median total salary for that employer. The bars are filled with a blue color, and the x-axis labels are rotated for better visualization.\n\n#scatter plot\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(salary, aes(x = employer, y = median_total_salary)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting graph is a scatter plot where each point represents a different employer. The x-axis shows the employers, and the y-axis shows the corresponding median total salary. This type of plot is useful for visualizing the distribution and relationships between individual data points for each employer.\n\n#line graph using ggplot\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(salary, aes(x = employer, y = median_total_salary, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = 'Employer Median Total Salary Line Graph', x = 'Employer') +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\nThe output graph is a line graph with employers on the x-axis, median total salaries on the y-axis, and a line connecting the median total salary points for each employer. The x-axis labels (employer names) will be rotated by 90 degrees for better visibility. The graph provides a visual representation of how median total salaries vary across different employers."
